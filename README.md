# Scenario

As the global population continues to increase, CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase as well. Consequently, temperatures have also risen causing volatile weather patterns and more extreme storms. As a result, organizations, such as emergency services and insurance firms, must respond appropriately.

# Project Overview 

The scope of this project is to see how major organizations involved in storm events must react in an effective and efficient manner, to meet the requirements of their stakeholders. Our database used for this project is from the year 1959 due to a lack of comprehensive information in other data sets for other years. The two major groups of organizations we focused on in this project are insurance firms and emergency services. We manipulated the data to seeâ€¦

1) Which states should have the highest insurance cost based on Tornado Events?
2) For which months should Emergency services invest the most payroll?
